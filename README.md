### Welcome to The Bee's Knees ### 

1. What is your project is/does (and what it's called)

This is a visual novel game. It is designed to be played through and tell a story. Follow along a very confused guy who's just trying to figure out where he is and why hes       there! Navigate through complicated relationships with people that seem to know more about you than yourself, and try not to land yourself in hot water.
   
2. Why you made your project?

This project was made to learn about how game creation works and the process. There was always the general idea to tell a story but the method of doing so was clear in the form of a visual novel. This was mostly a project full of learning and experiementing. It was a fun side project to turn to instead of watching an endless loop of youtube videos. 
   
4. How you made your project

This project was created in Ren'py, with illustrations made in procreate and ibis paint. 
   
6. what you struggled with and what you learned

The biggest struggle was when images wouldn't scale properly and the UI was ugly. Often uploading the images they are in different sizes which require different scaling, The UI change was needed for a more personal touch, it created space for the title screen to be seen. There's a lot to be learned such as you must create mutiple sprites for each emotion that you want your character to have! As well as understanding how dialogue flows to create a better story telling experience.
